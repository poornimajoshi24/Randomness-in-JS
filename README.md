📜 How It Works

A new div and h1 are created dynamically.

A random motivational message is picked from an array.

Random values are generated for:

Position (top, left)

Background color (rgb)

Rotation angle

The message is centered inside the box using Flexbox.

The box is appended to the <main> element.

🧠 Key JavaScript Concepts Used

DOM Selection (querySelector)

Event Handling (addEventListener)

Dynamic Element Creation (createElement)

Random Number Generation (Math.random)

Inline Styling via JavaScript

Flexbox for centering text

📸 Example Behavior

Click the button 👉 a new colorful message box appears
